   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set API Keys:**
   Replace the placeholders in `botScript.py` with your actual OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "your-elevenlabs-api-key"
   ```

4. **Install FFmpeg:**
   * **Windows:** Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.
   * **macOS:** Use Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```
   * **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager:

     ```

5. **Run the Assistant:**
   ```bash
   python botScript.py
   ```

## Notes
